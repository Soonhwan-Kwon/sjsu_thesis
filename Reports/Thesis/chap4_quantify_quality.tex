\chapter{Quantifying and Visualizing the Quality of a Mixed-Bag Solver Output}\label{chap:quantifyingSolverQuantify}

Modern jig swap puzzle solvers are not able to perfectly reconstruct the ground-truth input in many cases.  As such, quantifiable metrics are required to objectively compare the quality of outputs from different solvers.  Cho~\textit{et al.}~\cite{cho2010} defined two such metrics namely: direct accuracy and neighbor accuracy. These metrics have been used by others including \cite{sholomon2013, pomeranz2011, paikin2015, son2014, gallagher2012}.  This section discusses the existing quality metrics and outlines a set of enhancements to make these metrics more applicable to Mixed-Bag puzzles.  This thesis also proposes advanced metrics for quantifying the best buddy attributes of an image.  The final two sections propose new standards to visualize the quality of solver accuracy as well as the best buddy profile of images.

\section{Direct Accuracy}\label{sec:directAccuracy}

Direct accuracy is a relatively na\"{\i}ve quality metric; it is defined as the fraction of pieces placed in the same location in both the ground-truth (i.e., original) and solved image with respect to the total number of pieces. Equation~\eref{eq:directAccuracy} shows the formal definition of direct accuracy ($DA$), where $n$ is the total number of pieces and $c$ is the number of pieces in the solved image that are placed in their original (i.e., correct) location.  The solved image is referred to as ``perfectly reconstructed'' if all pieces are in the same location that they were in the original image (i.e., $DA=1$).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:directAccuracy}
DA = \frac{c}{n}
\end{equation}

This thesis proposes two new direct accuracy metrics namely: Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (EDAS) and Shiftable Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (SEDAS).  They are described in the following two subsections; the complementary relationship between EDAS and SEDAS is described in the third subsection.

\subsection{Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score}\label{sec:enhancedDirectAccuracyScore}

The standard direct accuracy metric does not account for the possibility that there may be pieces from multiple input puzzles in the same solver output image.  For a given a puzzle, $P_i$, in the set of input puzzles $P$ (i.e., $P_i \in P$) and a set of solved puzzles $S$ where $S_j$ is in $S$, Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (EDAS) is defined as shown in Equation~\eref{eq:enhancedDirectAccuracyScore}.  $c_{i,j}$ is the number of pieces from input puzzle $P_i$ correctly placed (with no rotation for Type~2 puzzles) in solved puzzle $S_j$ while $n_i$ is the number of pieces in puzzle $P_i$. $m_{k,j}$ is the number of pieces from an input puzzle $P_k$ (where $k \ne i$) that are also in $S_j$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:enhancedDirectAccuracyScore}
EDAS_{P_i} = \argmax_{S_j \in S}\frac{c_{i,j}}{n_i + \sum_{k \ne i}(m_{k,j})}
\end{equation}

Standard direct accuracy (see Equation~\eref{eq:directAccuracy}) and EDAS are equivalent when solving a single puzzle. What is more, like standard direct accuracy, a perfectly reconstructed puzzle will always have an EDAS of~1. 

For Mixed-Bag puzzles, EDAS necessarily marks as incorrect any pieces from $P_i$ that are not in $S_j$ by dividing by $n_i$.  What is more, the summation of term $m_{k,j}$ penalizes for any puzzle pieces in the solver output $S_j$ that are not from input puzzle $P_i$.  Therefore, EDAS takes into account both extra and missing pieces in the solver output.

It is important to note that EDAS is a score and not a measure of accuracy. While its value is bounded between 0 and 1 (inclusive), it is not specifically defined as the number of correct placements divided by the total number of placements since the denominator of Equation~\eref{eq:enhancedDirectAccuracyScore} is greater than or equal to the number of pieces in both $P_i$ and $S_j$.

\subsection{Shiftable Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score}\label{sec:shiftableEnhancedDirectAccuracy}

Standard direct accuracy is vulnerable to shifts in the solved image where even very minor placement errors can cause the reported accuracy to drop to~0.  Figure~\ref{fig:directAccuracyOnePieceEffect} shows a ground-truth image and an actual solver output when the puzzle boundaries were not fixed.  Note that only a single piece is misplaced; this shifted all other pieces to the right one location causing the direct accuracy to drop to zero.  Had this same piece been misplaced along either the right or bottom side of the image, the direct accuracy would have been largely unaffected.  The fact that direct accuracy can give such vastly differing results for essentially the same error shows that direct accuracy has a significant flaw.  This thesis proposes Shiftable Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (SEDAS) to address the often misleadingly punitive nature of standard direct accuracy. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{ >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{2.2in} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{2.2in} }
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=48mm]{./images/muffins_300x200.jpg}} & \fbox{\includegraphics[width=50.1mm]{./images/muffins_300x200_type1}}

	\\ ~\\
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Solver Output where a Single Misplaced Piece Catastrophically Affects the Direct Accuracy}
\label{fig:directAccuracyOnePieceEffect}
\end{figure}

Equation~\eref{eq:shiftableEnhancedDirectAccuracyScore} is the formal definition of $SEDAS$.  $d_{min}$ represents the Manhattan distance between the upper left corner of the solved image and the nearest placed puzzle piece.  Similarly, $L$ is the set of all possible puzzle piece locations within radius $d_{min}$ (inclusive) of the upper left corner of the image.  Given that $l$ is a location in $L$, the term, $c_{i,j}$ from Equation~\ref{eq:enhancedDirectAccuracyScore} has been changed to $c_{i,j,l}$ to denote that $l$ is used as a custom reference point when determining the number of pieces from the input puzzle that are correctly placed in the solved puzzle.  

\begin{equation} \label{eq:shiftableEnhancedDirectAccuracyScore}
SEDAS_{P_i} = \argmax_{l \in L} \bigg( \argmax_{S_j \in S}\frac{c_{i,j,l}}{n_i + \sum_{k \ne i}(m_{k,j})} \bigg)
\end{equation}


In the standard definition of direct accuracy proposed by Cho~\textit{et al.}, $l$ is fixed at the upper left corner of the image.  In contrast, SEDAS shifts this reference point within a radius of the upper left corner of the image in order to find a more meaningful value for direct accuracy. What is more, since pieces from input puzzle $P_i$ may have been placed in more than one of the output puzzles, SEDAS is calculated as the maximum value across all solved puzzles, $S$.

Rather than defining SEDAS based off the distance $d_{min}$, an alternative approach is to use the point anywhere in the solved image, $S_j$ that maximizes Equation~\eref{eq:shiftableEnhancedDirectAccuracyScore}.  However, that approach can take significantly longer to compute in particular when the solved puzzle has several thousand pieces.  SEDAS balances the need for a meaningful direct accuracy score against computation efficiency.

\subsection{Necessity of Using Both EDAS and SEDAS}\label{sec:importanceEdasSedas}

While EDAS can be misleadingly punitive, it cannot be wholly replaced by SEDAS.  Rather, EDAS and SEDAS serve complementary roles.  First, EDAS must necessarily be calculated as part of SEDAS since the upper left corner location is inherently a member of the set $L$. (When the solved puzzle is not shifted, it is the only location in $L$.)  Hence, there is no additional time required to calculate EDAS.  What is more, by continuing to use EDAS along with SEDAS, some shifts in the solved image may be quantified; this would not be possible if SEDAS was used alone.

\section{Neighbor Accuracy}\label{sec:neighborAccuracy}

Cho~\textit{et al.}~\cite{cho2010} defined neighbor accuracy as the ratio of puzzle pieces sides that are adjacent in both the original and solved images versus the total number of puzzle piece sides.  Formally, let $q$ be the number of sides each piece has (i.e., four in a jig swap puzzle) and $n$ be the number of pieces.  If $a$ is the number of puzzle piece sides adjacent in both the ground-truth and solved images, then the neighbor accuracy, $NA$, is defined as shown in Equation~\eref{eq:neighborAccuracy}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:neighborAccuracy}
NA = \frac{a}{n \cdot q}
\end{equation}

Unlike direct accuracy, neighbor accuracy is largely unaffected by shifts in the solved image since it considers only a piece's neighbors and not its absolute location.  However, the standard definition of neighbor accuracy does not encompass the case where pieces from multiple input puzzles may be present in the same solver output.  

\subsection{Enhanced Neighbor Accuracy Score}\label{sec:enhancedNeighborAccuracyScore}

Enhanced Neighbor Accuracy Score (ENAS) improves the neighbor accuracy metric by providing a framework to quantify the quality of Mixed-Bag solver outputs. 

Let $n_i$ be the number of puzzles pieces in the input puzzle $P_i$ and $a_{i,j}$ be the number of puzzle piece sides adjacent in $P_i$ and solved output $S_j$.  If $m_{k,j}$ is the number of puzzle pieces in $S_j$ from an input puzzle $P_k$ (where $k \ne i$), then the ENAS for $P_i$ is defined as shown in Equation~\eref{eq:enhancedNeighborAccuracyScore}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:enhancedNeighborAccuracyScore}
\ENAS_{P_i} = \argmax_{S_j \in S}\frac{a_{i,j}}{q (n_i + \sum_{k \ne i}(m_{k,j})}
\end{equation}

In the same fashion as the technique described for EDAS in Section~\ref{sec:enhancedDirectAccuracyScore}, ENAS divides by the number of pieces $n_i$ in input puzzle $P_i$.  By doing so, it effectively marks as incorrect any pieces from $P_i$ that are not in $S_j$.  What is more, by including in the denominator of Equation~\eref{eq:enhancedNeighborAccuracyScore} a summation of all $m_{k,j}$, ENAS marks as incorrect any pieces not from $P_i$ that are in $S_j$.  The combination of these two factors allows ENAS to account for extra and missing pieces.

\section{Best Buddy Metrics}\label{sec:bestBuddyMetrics}

Chapter~\ref{chap:previousWork} explains that two puzzle pieces are best buddies on their respective sides if they are both more similar to each other than they are to any other pieces.  This thesis refers to a best buddy relationship as ``adjacent'' if the two pieces are neighbors on their respective sides.  In contrast, ``non-adjacent'' best buddies are not neighbors.  Note that it is also possible that a piece has no best buddy at all on one or more sides.

Best buddy relationships have been used for segmentation~\cite{pomeranz2011}, placement~\cite{paikin2015}, and as an estimation metric~\cite{sholomon2013}.  The following subsections propose the first advanced best buddy metrics for both input and solved puzzles.

\subsection{Interior and Exterior Non-Adjacent Best Buddies}\label{sec:bestBuddyInteriorExterior}

If an image has fewer non-adjacent best buddies, it means that best buddy relationships are more accurate determiner of puzzle piece adjacency.  It is expected that a pair of best buddies are more likely to be non-adjacent if they are have no neighbor at all (i.e., the piece(s) is next to an open location like the edge of the image).  This is because those puzzle piece sides have no true neighbor leaving them more inclined to couple with an unrelated piece, which is often another piece's side with no neighbor.  This is illustrated by the example described in Section~\ref{sec:visualizingBestBuddies}.

This thesis subcategorizes non-adjacent best buddies depending on whether they are interior (i.e., the puzzle piece's side has an actual neighbor) or exterior (i.e., the puzzle piece's side has no neighbor).  Interior non-adjacent best buddies are generally more deleterious since they are more likely to affect both placement and segmentation. 

\subsection{Best Buddy Density}\label{sec:bestBuddyDensity}

As mentioned previously, each puzzle piece side may or may not have a best buddy relationship. For a puzzle consisting of $n$ pieces each of which has $q$ sides \footnote{In a jig swap puzzle, $q$ is equal to 4.}, Equation~\eref{eq:bestBuddyDensity} defines the best buddy density (BBD) for an image that has $b$ puzzle piece sides with best buddies.   BBD is bounded between 0 and 1 (inclusive), and a higher best buddy density indicates that the individual puzzle pieces can be more easily differentiated from one another.  

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bestBuddyDensity}
BBD = \frac{b}{n \cdot q}
\end{equation}

Ideally, all adjacent puzzle piece sides would be best buddies, and there would be no exterior best buddies. In such cases, the best buddy density would actually be less than~1; the extent to which it would be below~1 is dependent on the puzzle dimensions. What is more, best buddy density may vary across an image. Equation~\eref{eq:bestBuddyDensity} can be adjusted to a more localized metric by considering only a subset of the connected pieces.

\section{Visualizing the Quality of Solver Outputs}\label{sec:visualizingSolverAccuracy}

In images with thousands of pieces, it is often difficult to visually determine the location of individual pieces that are incorrectly placed.  What is more, visual tools help developers quickly detect and fix latent bugs.  The following two subsections describe the standards developed as part of this thesis for visualizing direct and neighbor accuracy.

\subsection{Visualizing EDAS and SEDAS}\label{sec:visualizingEdasSedas}

In standard direct accuracy, EDAS, and SEDAS, each puzzle piece is assigned a single value (i.e., correctly or incorrectly placed).  Due to that, the direct accuracy visualization represents each puzzle by a square filled with a solid color.  One additional refinement used in this thesis is to subdivide the ``incorrect'' placements into a set of subcategories; they are, in order of precedence: wrong puzzle, wrong location, and wrong rotation.  Note that the ``wrong puzzle'' classification applies only to Mixed-Bag puzzles and occurs when a piece in the solver output is does not from the puzzle of interest, $P_i$.  Table~\ref{tab:directAccuracyColors} shows the colors assigned to puzzle pieces depending on their direct accuracy classification.  Assuming no missing pieces in the ground-truth image, the ideal EDAS and SEDAS visualization would have the same dimensions as the ground-truth input and would consist of only green squares.

 \hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\caption{Color Scheme for Puzzles Pieces in Direct Accuracy Visualizations}\label{tab:directAccuracyColors}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:directAccuracyVisualization} shows a Type~2 solver output as well as its associated EDAS and SEDAS visualizations. Since four puzzle pieces were erroneously placed on the left of the image, all but one piece had the wrong location according to EDAS; the only exception is a single piece that had the right location but wrong rotation.  In contrast, almost all pieces have the correct location in the SEDAS representation; note that the piece in the correct location but wrong rotation in EDAS has the wrong location in SEDAS.

\subsection{Visualizing ENAS}\label{sec:visualizingNeighborAccuracy}

In a jig swap puzzle, a piece may have best buddies on up to four sides (since the pieces are square).  As such, each piece in the ENAS visualization is divided into four isosceles triangles; the base of each triangle is along the side of the puzzle piece whose neighbor accuracy is being represented.  A puzzle piece's four isosceles triangles all share a common, non-base vertex at the piece's center.  Table~\ref{tab:neighborAccuracyColors} defines the color assigned to each triangle depending on whether a piece's neighbors match in the ground-truth input and the solver output.  

\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.9in} | >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.9in} | >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.9in} | >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.9in} | >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.9in} | }

    Wrong Puzzle & Wrong Neighbor & Correct Neighbor  & No Piece Present  \\ \hline

 \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Color Scheme for Puzzles Piece Sides in Neighbor Accuracy Visualizations}\label{tab:neighborAccuracyColors}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:neigborAccuracyVisualization} shows an actual output when solving a Mixed-Bag puzzle with two images.  In this example, the puzzle of interest ($P_i$) is the glass and stone building while the other puzzle ($P_k$) is the rainforest house.  All pieces that came from the rainforest house image are shown as blue despite being assembled correctly; this is because they are not from the puzzle of interest.  All neighbors from the puzzle of interest (i.e., the glass and stone building) that are placed next to their original neighbor are represented by green triangles while all incorrect neighbors, such as those bordering the rainforest house image, are represented by red triangles.

\section{Visualizing Best Buddies}\label{sec:visualizingBestBuddies}

The visualization for best buddies is similar to that of neighbor accuracy.  Hence, each puzzle piece in the best buddy visualization is divided into four isosceles triangles with each triangle representing the piece's best buddy relationship with its neighbor.  Table~\ref{tab:bestBuddyColors} defines the color scheme used to denote the three best buddy relationships outlined in Section~\ref{sec:bestBuddyMetrics}.

Figure~\ref{fig:bestBuddyVisualization} shows an example image and its associated best buddy visualization.  Despite having 16~times more interior sides, the image in this figure still has more than 3~times as many exterior, non-adjacent best buddies than interior, non-adjacent best buddies.
