\chapter{Incorrectly Classified Single Puzzle Images}\label{chap:incorreclyClassifiedSingleImages}

The Mixed-Bag Solver's ability to determine the number of ground-truth images passed to the solver was tested using the Pomeranz \textit{et al.} dataset~\cite{pomeranzBenchmarkImages} containing 20 images each with 805 pieces.  This test measures the performance ceiling of the solver to determine the number of input puzzles.  

The Mixed-Bag Solver (MBS) correctly identified that was only a single ground-truth input for 17 out of the 20 images.  Figure~\ref{fig:groundTruthSingleImageIncorrectlyIdentified} shows the three images that the Mixed-Bag Solver were unable to identify being a single image.  Figure~\ref{fig:mixedBagSolverOuputsSingleImageIncorrectlyIdentified} contains the Mixed-Bag Solver's output for these images; clearly, the solver struggled with the large areas of the image where there was little variation (e.g., blue sky, smooth water).  Paikin~\& Tal note in~\cite{paikin2015} that their assembler does not perform well on such images.  Therefore, it is expected the Mixed-Bag Solver's performance on these images may have improved had a different assembler been used.
