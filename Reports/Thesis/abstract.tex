Square jigsaw puzzle solving is a variant of a standard jigsaw puzzles, wherein all pieces are equal-sized squares that must be placed adjacent to one another to match an original image.  This thesis proposes an algorithm that can solve multiple square jigsaw puzzles simultaneously without any information provided to it beyond the set of puzzle pieces.  The algorithm has been able to assemble up to 10 images simultaneously with results comparable to the state-of-the-art solver working on each image individually.

This thesis also defines the first set of metrics specifically tailored for multiple puzzle solvers.  It also outlines the first visualization standards for representing the quality of solver solutions.
