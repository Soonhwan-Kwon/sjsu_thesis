The square jigsaw puzzle is a variant of traditional jigsaw puzzles, wherein all pieces are equal-sized squares; these pieces must be placed adjacent to one another to reconstruct an original image.  This thesis proposes a novel solver based on hierarchical clustering that can reconstruct multiple square jigsaw puzzles simultaneously without any information beyond the set of puzzle pieces.  This algorithm has been verified on up to 10 puzzles simultaneously, which is double the current state of the art.

In addition, this thesis defines Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (EDAS), Shiftable Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (SEDAS), and Enhanced Neighbor Accuracy Score (ENAS), which are the first quality metrics specifically tailored for Mixed-Bag puzzles.  This thesis also outlines the first visualization standards for representing best buddies and the quality of solver solutions.
