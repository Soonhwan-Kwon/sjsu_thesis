\chapter{Experimental Results}\label{chap:experimentalResults}

A set of experiments were performed to compare the performance of the Mixed-Bag Solver and Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm.  These experiments followed the standard test conditions collectively used by \cite{cho2010, pomeranz2011, gallagher2012, sholomon2013, paikin2015}.  For example, each square puzzle piece was 28 pixels wide.  Likewise, all image information was represented using the LAB~colorspace.  What is more, only the more challenging Type~2 puzzles were investigated, meaning piece location and rotation were unknown.  Furthermore, the solvers were not provided any information concerning the dimension of the ground-truth input(s).

Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm requires that the number of input puzzles be specified; in contrast, the Mixed-Bag Solver is not externally supplied any information other than the puzzle pieces.  As such, this represents an advantage for Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm yet, the Mixed-Bag Solver still significantly outperforms their algorithm.

To compare the performance of the Mixed-Bag Solver and Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm on multiple images, this thesis used Pomeranz~\textit{et al.}'s dataset that contains twenty 805~piece images~\cite{pomeranzBenchmarkImages}.  In each test, a specified number of images (ranging from two to five) were randomly selected, without replacement from the image pool.  The outputs generated by the two solvers were then compared.  Table~\ref{tab:numberSolverIterations} shows the number of times each solver was run for a given number of input puzzles. As explained in Section~\ref{sec:assemblerTimeComplexity}, the execution time of Paikin~\& Tal's assembler can grow cubicly, especially if best buddy density is low.  As such, the solvers were run fewer times as the number of input puzzles increased.

\section{Accuracy of the Mixed-Bag Solver in Determining the Number of Input Puzzles}

For the Mixed-Bag Solver to provide meaningful outputs, it must be able to identify the number of ground-truth inputs provided to the solver.  This section reviews the Mixed-Bag Solver's performance in this regard.  The first subsection discusses the solver's performance when provided only a single image.  This is separated from the more general discussion as the algorithm's performance on a single image represents its accuracy ceiling.  The algorithm's performance when solving two to five puzzles is discussed in a separate subsection.

\subsection{Single Puzzle Solving}\label{sec:singlePuzzleSolving}

The Mixed-Bag solver was able to correctly identify the single ground-truth image for 17~out of the 20~images in the Pomeranz \textit{et al.}'s dataset (i.e., 85\% accuracy).  For the remaining three images, the Mixed-Bag Solver incorrectly found that the pieces came from two images, meaning, the error was at most only a single output puzzle. Appendix~\ref{chap:incorreclyClassifiedSingleImages} shows the ground-truth inputs and Mixed-Bag Solver outputs for these three misclassified images.  

It is clear that the solver struggles to correctly identify the number of input puzzles when the image has large areas with little variation (e.g., a clear sky, smooth water, etc.). Two example images from the Pomeranz~\textit{et al.} dataset are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pomeranzBestBuddiesVisualizations}.  The Mixed-Bag Solver was able to perfectly reconstruct image~(a); in contrast, the Mixed-Bag Solver thought the pieces from image~(b) came from two separate puzzles. The best buddy visualizations in Figure~\ref{fig:pomeranzBestBuddiesVisualizations} shows that image~(a) has a significantly higher best buddy density than image~(b) as well as much fewer interior non-adjacent best buddies.  It is these two factors that contributed the most to the Mixed-Bag Solver being unable to determine the number of input images for the three images in Appendix~\ref{chap:incorreclyClassifiedSingleImages}.

\label{fig:pomeranzBestBuddiesVisualizations}
\end{figure} 

It is important to note that the difficulty the Mixed-Bag Solver has reconstructing images with low best buddy density is actually an artifact of the assembler and not the solver.  Paikin~\& Tal mentioned in~\cite{paikin2015} that their solver may yield ``unsatisfactory results'' on such images.

\subsection{Multiple Puzzle Solving}

As mentioned previously, the Mixed-Bag Solver was tested by randomly selecting a specified number of images, without replacement, from Pomeranz \textit{et al.}'s  from the 805~piece dataset.  Figure~\ref{fig:inputPuzzleCountErrorFrequency} illustrates the performance of the Mixed-Bag Solver in identifying number of input puzzles when passed multiple images.  A correct estimation of the number of puzzles would represent an error of ``0'' in the figure.  Similarly, an overestimation of a single puzzle (e.g., the solver identified four puzzles when only three were provided as an input) would represent an error of ``1''.  Across all of the experiments, the Mixed-Bag Solver never underestimated the number of input puzzles; what is more, it never overestimated the number of input puzzles by more than 3.

\caption{Mixed-Bag Solver's Input Puzzle Count Error Frequency}
\label{fig:inputPuzzleCountErrorFrequency}
\end{figure}

In this set of experiments, the Mixed-Bag solver correctly determined the number of input puzzles in 65\% of the tests.  Likewise, in less than 8\% of the tests did the solver overestimate the number of input puzzles by more than one.  Since the solver never underestimated the number of input puzzles, it is clear that the solver is over-rejecting the merger of cluster and/or creating very small clusters that are too isolated to merge with other clusters.  It is expected that this aspect of the solver's performance would be improved by reducing the minimum clustering threshold (see Section~\ref{sec:hierarchicalClustering}) as well as increasing the minimum segment size (see Section~\ref{sec:segmentPuzzle}).

\caption{Performance of the Mixed-Bag and Paikin~\& Tal Solvers with Multiple Input Puzzles}\label{fig:graphSolverPerformanceComparison}
\end{figure}


As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, images were randomly selected from the Pomeranz~\textit{et al.} dataset and provided to the Mixed-Bag Solver as well as Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm.  Table~\ref{tab:tableSolverPerformanceComparison} and Figure~\ref{fig:graphSolverPerformanceComparison} show the quantified quality of the outputs generated by  both solvers for varying input puzzle counts.   The three metrics used are the mean Shiftable Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (SEDAS), mean Enhanced Neighbor Accuracy Score (ENAS), and the percentage of puzzles assembled perfectly (i.e., input and output puzzles are an identical match).  The results for the Mixed-Bag Solver (MBS) are subdivided between the case when the number of input puzzles was correctly determined (denoted with a ``$\dagger$'' in the table heading) versus all solver results (denoted with a ``$\ddagger$'').  The reason for this distinction is that the former category represents the performance ceiling of the solver if the hierarchical clustering stage performed optimally. 

Across all quality metrics and categories, the Mixed-Bag Solver significantly outperformed Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm.  This is despite the fact that only their algorithm was provided additional information concerning the number of input puzzles.  What is more, unlike Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm, there was no significant decrease in the performance of the Mixed-Bag Solver as the number of input puzzles was increased.  In addition, the Mixed-Bag Solver did not see a substantial difference in solution quality if it incorrectly estimated the number of input images; this indicates that the extra puzzles generated by the Mixed-Bag Solver were relatively insignificant in size since they did not meaningfully affect SEDAS or ENAS.  

\section{Ten Puzzle Solving}

Paikin~\& Tal's~\cite{paikin2015} algorithm was shown to be able to solve up to five images simultaneously, which represents the most in the current literature.  To achieve this, their solver needed to be supplied with the number of input puzzles.  In contrast, this thesis' solver has been shown to work on up to 10 puzzles, which is double the current state of the art, while receiving less information.

Appendix~\ref{chap:tenPuzzleSolving} contains the set of ten images that were inputs to both the Mixed-Bag Solver (MBS) and Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm.  The comparison of their respective performance is shown in Table~\ref{tab:pomeranzBestBuddiesVisualizations}.  Despite the Mixed-Bag Solver receiving less information, it scored greater than 0.9 for both Shiftable Enhanced Direct Accuracy Score (SEDAS) and the Enhanced Neighbor Accuracy Score (ENAS) on all puzzles.  In contrast, Paikin~\& Tal only exceeded a SEDAS and ENAS of 0.9 for image~(f). Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm particularly struggled to select quality puzzle seeds with the starting pieces of nine of the output puzzles coming from just three of the input images.

This test set also shows that the Mixed-Bag Solver has greater immunity to potential shifts in the solved output than Paikin~\& Tal's algorithm.  This is evident in the fact that only four of the Mixed-Bag Solver's outputs showed a shift that would affect EDAS while seven of Paikin~\& Tal's outputs were shifted.
