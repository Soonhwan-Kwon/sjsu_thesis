<h1>CS299 Proposal</h1>

<h2>Abstract:</h2>
	<p> 
	Solving a jigsaw puzzle entails arranging a fixed set of pieces such that they reconstruct an original source image. 
	With a traditional jigsaw puzzle, finding the solution is straightforward as interpiece mechanical
	incongruence and knowledge of the solution image reduce the number of possible piece permutations.  
	<br/><br/>
	This project proposes an algorithm that can simultaneously reconstruct multiple jigsaw puzzles consisting of uniform, square pieces.
	Unlike previous work, the algorithm takes no outside information (e.g., number of input puzzles).  In contrast, the algorithm uses
	the image information from the bag of individual, input pieces.
	</p>

Innovations and Challenges
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>In traditional jigsaw puzzles, pieces usually have unique or significantly different shapes.  This significantly simplifies 
	jigsaw puzzle solving since shape alone can be used to definitively determine that some pieces are not adjacent.
	In constrast, the puzzle pieces in this are equal sized squares which eliminates the use of shape in determining
	piece adjacency.</li>
	
	<li>Most previous work on the jigsaw puzzle problem focused on solving only a single puzzle at a time.  Solving multiple (in particular)
	large puzzles increases the number of piece permutations and introduces the complexity of dividing the input set of pieces
	into disjoint subsets.</li>
	
	<li>Puzzles with missing pieces are more difficult since one cannot assume all internal pieces have a neighbor.  What is more, missing puzzle
	pieces increase the likelihood that two puzzle pieces will have an artificially high pairwise similarity.  Both of these increase the difficulty
	in solving a puzzle.</li>
	
	<li>Develop the first solver that takes no outside input other than the bag of puzzle pieces.</li>
</ul>
